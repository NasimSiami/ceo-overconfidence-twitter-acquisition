# ðŸ“ˆ CEO Overconfidence in M&A: The Twitter Case

This project analyzes the role of CEO overconfidence in M&A overpayment, using Elon Muskâ€™s $44B acquisition of Twitter as a real-world case. It replicates and extends the methodology from the academic paper *"It Takes Two to Tango: Overpayment and Value Destruction in M&A Deals."*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To investigate whether Elon Musk's overconfidence as CEO contributed to a significant acquisition premium, using both behavioral finance metrics and discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation.

---

## ðŸ§  Methods
- Literature-based replication of overconfidence metrics (Holder67 method)
- Construction of regression models with control variables
- Empirical tests using panel data from 1993â€“2020
- Case analysis of Twitter's intrinsic value using a DCF model

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings
- Overconfident CEOs pay on average **1.9%â€“4.7%** higher premiums in M&A deals
- In the Twitter case, DCF analysis reveals a **~52% overpayment**
- Behavioral traits such as overconfidence are measurable and significantly influence acquisition outcomes

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)
- Academic databases: CRSP, Compustat, ExecuComp, SDC Thomson One
- Discounted Cash Flow modeling with sensitivity analysis
